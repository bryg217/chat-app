# Chat App

## Description

Project that implements a "dumb" chatbot; this allows for a user to have a non-sensical conversation with the "chatbot".

## Purpose

To experiement with new tech, as well as older ones that I am curious about.

Main Technologies:
* frontend
  * `Vue.js`
    * Since I am a frontend engineer, I wanted to play around with `Vue`
      (the new)
* backend
  * `express.js`
    * Again, since I am a frontend engineer, I don't get to play around
      with the latest backend tech on a daily basis, so this was my attempt
      to play with a backend tech
* Other
  * `socket.io`
    * Used in both front and back ends
    * Used as base library for chat
